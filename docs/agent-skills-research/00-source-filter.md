# Agent Skills Research - Phase 1: Source Filtering

**Date:** 2026-02-02  
**Phase:** Source Filtering (Quick Pass)  
**Objective:** Identify sources with relevant skills for X4 Foundations AI Assistant

---

## Filtering Criteria

A source will be **filtered out** if:
- Repository is empty or archived
- Contains only documentation/guides (no actual skills/tools)
- Language-specific and incompatible (e.g., Python-only when we need TypeScript/JavaScript)
- Not related to AI agents, MCP, or relevant tooling
- Access is restricted or repository doesn't exist

A source is **viable** if:
- Contains actual skills, tools, or MCP servers
- Skills are language-agnostic or compatible with TypeScript/JavaScript
- Repository is active and maintained
- Has clear documentation or code examples

## Quick Pass Results

*This section will be filled during Phase 1 research*

### Viable Sources (Move to Phase 2)

| # | Repository | Reason | Skills Preview |
|---|------------|--------|----------------|
| - | - | - | - |

### Filtered Out Sources

| # | Repository | Reason for Filtering |
|---|------------|---------------------|
| - | - | - |

## Next Steps

1. Review each viable source in detail (Phase 2)
2. Create individual research reports
3. Apply prioritization framework
4. Document findings

---

## Notes

- This is a living document that will be updated as filtering progresses
- Quick pass should take 2-5 minutes per source
- Focus on identifying what the repository contains, not evaluating individual skills yet
- Detailed evaluation happens in Phase 2
