## Overview

A comprehensive Claude skill for Obsidian plugin development. Encodes 27 ESLint rules, submission guidelines, security practices, and best practices for creating Obsidian plugins.

---

## Key Features

### 1. Knowledge Base

- All 27 `eslint-plugin-obsidianmd` rules
- Official submission guidelines
- Memory management patterns
- Security and XSS prevention
- Platform compatibility (including iOS)
- UI/UX best practices

### 2. Automation Tools

- Validation checklist automation
- Boilerplate generator
- Code quality checks
- Submission readiness verification

### 3. Progressive Disclosure

- Loads essential rules first
- Full documentation on demand
- Optimized for token efficiency

---

## Evaluation

### Overall Assessment

**Q1: Primary workflow support?**
- [ ] NO - Obsidian plugins are not X4 assistant functionality

**Q3: Meaningful improvement for common cases?**
- [ ] NO - Not relevant to X4 game assistant

**Q4: Cheap + low-risk?**
- [x] YES - Interesting patterns to study

### Category: 🚫 DROP (Not Relevant)

**Reason:** Obsidian-specific skill with no applicability to X4 Foundations game assistant. The plugin development patterns are valuable but for a completely different ecosystem.

---

## Patterns Worth Noting

### 1. Specialized Knowledge Encoding

**Concept:** Encode domain-specific rules and best practices into a skill

**Pattern Value:** Could apply to X4-specific knowledge base

```markdown
# Example: X4 equivalent
- X4 REST API patterns
- Game data structure knowledge
- Station/ship type rules
- Faction relationship logic
```

### 2. Validation Checklists

**Concept:** Automated compliance checking

**Pattern Value:** Quality assurance for MCP tools

### 3. Boilerplate Generation

**Concept:** Scaffold new components with best practices

**Pattern Value:** MCP tool templates

---

## Summary

### Priority: 🚫 DROP

| Aspect | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| **X4 Relevance** | None - Obsidian-specific |
| **Pattern Value** | Medium - Knowledge encoding |
| **Integration Effort** | N/A - Not applicable |
| **Recommendation** | Skip, but note patterns |

### Key Takeaway

While the skill itself is not relevant, the approach of encoding domain-specific knowledge (rules, best practices, validation) into a skill is valuable. Could inspire an "X4-knowledge-skill" that encodes game mechanics and API patterns.
